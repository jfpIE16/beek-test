# ETL Challenge
1. Model a table that shows us the data from when a user signs up to when a user pays for a subscription. Think about the business cases and model the data to be consistent with the business.
2. Build an ETL that takes the information from those tables and makes a CSV file with the resulting table defined above.
    * The ETL must run at 06:00 GMT -3.
    * In case of failure of the ETL, have to send an email.
    * Propose tests that validate the consistency of the data and how they will be implemented.
3. The ETL code will be reviewed together in an onsite interview scheduled with our data team.
